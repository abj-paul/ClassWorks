* Result of the Analysis
- A lot of ports are open in each site.

In each of our ACK scans, http and https ports were filtered. It also makes sense because we have noticed that almost all govt servers run almost same kind of services under same condition.

** Scanning Ports using ACK packet
It is a different port scanning as it does not find out whether a port is open or closed. Rather it finds out if the firewall filteres the packets for that port.
It sends a empty ACK packet. If the packet goes through firewall and reaches the TCP port, they will return RST packet. If the firewall drops the packet, then no response will arrive. Thus, we can easily identify whether a port is filtered or unfiltered (firewall enabled or not).

We found the following results from TCP ACK scan.
1. moi,bdpost,shed has all ports unfiltered except for http and https.
2. eprocure has all ports filtered.
3. dhakasouthcity wensite is a special case.2 of its ports(ssh,ldp) are filtered. All other ports are unflitered.

*** Analysis of Output
We did notice one inconsistency here. That is, bdpost.gov.bd ACK scan contains ~sip-service~ unfiltered while SYN scan does not contain this port. We then looked into why this happened.

Is it due to random chances of unpredictable network condition? So we ran the experiment for the site again. 
| PORT     | STATE  | SERVICE      |
|----------+--------+--------------|
| 80/tcp   | open   | http         |
| 389/tcp  | closed | ldap         |
| 443/tcp  | open   | https        |
| 1503/tcp | closed | imtc-mcs     |
| 1719/tcp | closed | h323gatestat |
| 1720/tcp | closed | h323q931     |
| 2000/tcp | closed | cisco-sccp   |
| 5060/tcp | closed | sip          |
We can see that it was indeed due to random chances. The new TCP SYN scan output contains sip-service.
** Scanning Ports using SYN packet/Stealth Scan
We get the ***same output*** as TCP Port scan, naturally.
However, we do need to understand that the difference between TCP port scan and SYN scan is that, TCP port scan establishes a connection with the port while TCP Syn only sends SYN packet and receives the SYN-ACK to confirm the TCP port is open. So it is possible to scan thousands of ports per second using this method.
It is called stealth scan because it never completes a full TCP connection. Because of the stealth and fastness of this method, it is the most popular TCP port scanning method.

*** Further Analysis
We found ~OPEN|FILTERED~ response after scanning UDP ports in eprocure.gov.bd This is a very interesting output. Each UDP protocol has different packet format and nmap sends empty packets for most services. As a result, the UDP ports will drop the packet. It means, the port is open as no SMTP error message were returned. Or at least it was true in early internet. Nowadays, firewall are used in every server and the firewall can also drop packets. So there is no way to verify whether the packet drop was due to firewall or UDP service. So in 2004, a new version of nmap came out and it defined this new output: OPEN or FILTERED.

This issue can be managed if we send service-specific package instead of empty packets. The UDP port will reply to the packet in this case and thus, we can identify open ports from filtered ports. The service scanning command of nmap (~nmap -sUV -F felix.nmap.org~) sends service-specific packets by default. So we will use that to check if eprocure.gov.bd has any open UDP port.

The default script returned the OS version, service list, SSL-Certificate and version that we have already seen. So the outputs won't be recorded in the document but they will be in the experimentaiton folder for the respective sites.

Surprisingly, all IDS script using ~-D RND~ came out empty. Is it due to random chances? So we ran the command again and indeed, it was due to random chances.
