* Chp 6 - Directness in Good-News & Neutral Message

Direct Order : Directly go to the point. Usually in small messages.
Indirect order: First tell some stuffs then go to the point. Usually in long messages.


If reader's reaction will be positive or neutral, direct order is recommended. If reader's reaction might be negative, then indirect order is recommended.
** Direct Order
The General Direct Plan is a common structure used for organizing written or verbal messages, such as business letters or presentations. It consists of four main parts:

1. Start with the objective: Begin by stating the purpose of your message or what you want to achieve. This helps to focus the reader's or listener's attention on the main point and provides a clear direction for the message.

2. Include any necessary identification information: If there is any information the reader or listener needs to know in order to understand the message, such as a reference number or account information, include it after the objective.

3. Cover the remainder of the objective: Provide any additional details or supporting information that the reader or listener needs to know in order to understand the message.

4. End with goodwill: Conclude the message with a positive statement or gesture, such as thanking the reader or listener for their time or expressing a desire to continue the business relationship.
   - We shall me most grateful for your help.
   - ~I shall appreciate your usual promptness in clearing up this matter.~
   - Thank you for considering my request. I appreciate your support and understanding.

Following this plan can help ensure that your message is clear, concise, and effective in achieving its intended purpose.


Sure, here is an example of a message organized using the General Direct Plan:
#+begin_src text
Objective: Request for Time Off

Identification: Employee ID #1234

Dear Manager,

I am writing to request time off for a family event. My Employee ID is #1234.

I would like to request time off from work for the period of June 15th to June 18th. My sister is getting married on June 17th and I would like to attend the wedding and spend time with my family.

During my absence, I will ensure that all of my current projects are completed or handed off to my colleagues. I will also provide my contact information in case of any emergencies.

Thank you for considering my request. I appreciate your support and understanding.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

** Writing Queries

If it is a ~routined inquiry~, then the reader is likely to grant the request. In such case, use direct order.

It has the following steps.
1. Begin by directly stating the objective
2. Include any necessary explanation
3. If a number of questions are involved, give them structure. (routined inquiry has "question" in the name - you ask the reader some stuffs, like is the teaching condition in IIT satisfactory to you?)
4. End with goodwill.


Notice that, typical direct order requires identification in second step. But in routined query direct order, the "identification" step is absent. It is because routined query means the reader expects this document from you so extensive identification is not needed in the beginning. You may add it in the end.
*** Inquiries about people
It is a special form of inquiry because here,
1. We need to pay special attention to respting human rights
2. Need to structure it around the one job


It has same structure as any other inquiry writing.


CONSENT!


	  Dear Mr. Bateman:
Will you please assist me in evaluating Ms. Alice Barron for work as a district sales manager
with us. In her application Ms. Barron indicated that she worked for you as a salesperson
from early 2001 to 2005. ~She has authorized this inquiry.~
The work for which we are considering Ms. Barron involves supervision a staff of four
salespeople plus an office staff of two. While with you, did Ms. Barron show the leadership
ability such an assignment requires?
As a manger, Ms. Barron would need to know administration. She would be responsible for
running the business end of an office. Do you feel she has the necessary knowledge and
ability
** Writing Response
If the response is favourable (e.g. you are complying reader's request, the news is good), then direct order is used.

- Head
  1. Begin with the answer to the query or by saying that you are complying with the request
  2. Identify the message being answered in the beginning or in a subject line.

- Body
  1. Continue to give what is wanted in an orderly arrangement.
  2. If any answer is bad news, give sufficient extras.
     
- Ends in goodwill

** Adjustment grants

* Chp 7 - Maintaining good-will in bad news
Indirect order is used for bad news message because You can't just randomly say "oopsie all your stocks now worth 3$." Thats gonna ruin your partnership and reputation. So sugarcoat!

* Chp 8 - Indirectness in Persuasive Message
When we want to persuade people into buying our sus product, we need to add a lot of rubber-stamp and sugarcoating words. Hence indirectness is needed in persuasive and sales messages.

Here, our goal is to ask for something that the reader is likely to reject. Hence we must develop a strategy that will convince the reader otherwise.
** Persuasive Message
Yes, that's correct. Here is a more detailed explanation of the procedure for writing a persuasive request, as outlined in 8-4:

1. Open with attention-grabbing words: Begin the message with words that capture the reader's attention and set the tone for the persuasion that follows. This might be a provocative statement, a surprising fact, or a rhetorical question, for example.

2. Present the strategy: Use persuasive language and a you-viewpoint to present the reasons why the reader should take the desired action. This might include highlighting the benefits to the reader or emphasizing the negative consequences of not taking action.

3. Make the request: Clearly and directly make the request without any negative language. State what you want the reader to do and when you need it done by.

4. End with a recall to action: End the message with a reminder of the appeal or with words that reinforce the persuasive strategy. This might be a restatement of the benefits to the reader or a call to action that emphasizes the urgency of the situation.

Here's an example of how you might use this procedure to write a persuasive request:

#+begin_src text
Dear Manager,

As you know, our department has been struggling to meet our sales targets for the last few months. I believe I have a solution that can help us turn things around and start hitting our numbers again.

The strategy I propose is to invest in a new marketing campaign that targets a wider audience and highlights the unique benefits of our products. By doing so, we can increase our brand awareness and generate more leads, which should lead to increased sales.

I request that we allocate a budget of $10,000 to this marketing campaign and begin implementation within the next two weeks. This is a crucial step to help us meet our sales targets and position our department for success.

Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

* Chp 10-11
* Chp 13 - Oral & Interpersonal Communication
Talking = informal oral communication

** Discuss about the prevalance of oral communication
We spend more time talking than writing. Hence oral communication is very important.

Most of our work requires informal communication, starting from morning meetings, club meetings, inter-group communication etc. And thus, having a better informal communication skill pushes you forward in your job.

We also need formal oral communication sometimes, like in:
1. Committee meetings
2. Conference
3. Group discussions
4. Dictation
5. Meetings
6. Speeches
7. Orcal Reports
   

** Elements of Good Talking
The techniques of good talking use four basic elements.
1. Voice Quality: Talking slow or fast, unpleasant to melodious voice, talking in monotone, effect of high pitch - we know all of these. Using these knowledge, we can record our voice, listen to it and then make conscious effort to improve it.
2. Style: Style of talking projects speaker's personality. Some people sounds convincing, confident, other sounds sincere, some sounds confused, some sounds passive-aggressive. So understand your talking style and make appropriate changes.
3. Word Choice: In formal communication, you should not use words you use casually with your friends. Additionally, you should use words that are respectful. You should use words that the listener's would understand while also making sure that you are not talking down on the knowledge of listeners.
4. Adaptation to Your Audience: Aside from word choice, it also includes adapting to voice and style. For example, when the voice, style, and words in an oral message aimed at children would be different for the same message aimed at adults.

** Courtesy in conversation
- Do not interrupt.
- Don't talk loudly.
- Encourage others to make their voice heard.

** Techniques for conducting meeting
You are the leader of the meeting so you need to know some techniques of conducting the meeting. You need to plan.

1. Plan Ahead: Develop an agenda(list of topics) that needs to be covered to achieve the goal of the meeting. Then you should order those topics - which topics should be discussed first and which later. Then you should send this agenda to participants before the meeting.
2. Follow the plan: Meetings tend to stray from the agenda topics as new topics come up. As the leader, you should control the flow of the meeting - keep the new topics for the end of the meeting or for a future meeting.
3. Move the discussion along: You should bring agenda topics one after another has been completed. You should control the meeting from straying. But you also need to ensure that you are not interrupting rudely, that the person has made their point.
4. Control those who talk too much: Some people tend to dominate the meeting. You should control them by summarizing their viewpoints when they have said enough or moving to next topic.
5. Encourage participation for those who talk too little
6. Control Time: When meeting time is limited, you need to plan how much time each item should possess. It is useful to mention time-left during meeting to make participants aware.
7. Summarize at appropriate places: You should tell summary of discussion of one topic before moving to another topic. If discussion resulted in multiple viewpoints, you can call vote after summarizing viewpoints.
8. Take meeting minutes: Assign the task of taking meeting minutes to someone.

** Techniques for participating in a meeting
1. Follow the agenda: You should not bring up items that are not related to current agenda topic.
2. Participate
3. Don't talk too much
4. Cooperate: Respect the leader or his effort to make progress. Also respect other participants.
5. Be courteous: You should respect their rights and opinion and you should let them speak.
