<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
This chapter touches on the following ethical topics that are pertinent to organizations in the IT industry, as well as to organizations that make use of IT:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The use of nontraditional workers, including temporary workers, contractors, consulting firms, H-1B visa workers, and outsourced offshore workers, gives an organization more flexibility in meeting its staffing needs, often at a lower cost Ethics of IT Organizations than if the organization used traditional workers. The use of nontraditional workers also raises ethical issues for organizations. When should such nontraditional workers be employed, and how does such employment affect an organization’s ability to grow and develop its own employees? How does the use of nontraditional workers impact the wages of the organization’s own employees?</li>
<li>Whistle-blowing, as discussed in Chapter 2, is an effort to attract public attention to a negligent, illegal, unethical, abusive, or dangerous act by a company or some other organization. It is an important ethical issue for individuals and organizations. How can you safely and effectively report mis- conduct, and how should managers handle a whistle-blowing incident?</li>
<li>Green computing is a term applied to a variety of efforts directed toward the efficient design, manufacture, operation, and disposal of IT-related products, including personal computers, laptops, servers, printers, and printer supplies. Computer manufacturers and end users are faced with many questions about when and how to transition to green computing, and at what cost.</li>
<li>The electronics and information and communications technology (ICT) industry recognizes the need for a code to address ethical issues in the areas of worker safety and fairness, environmental responsibility, and business efficiency. What has been done so far, and what still needs to be done.</li>

<h3 id="org51b4ccb"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Contingent Work</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Contingent work is a job situation in which an individual does not have an <code>explicit or implicit contract</code> for long-term employment.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgd751317" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd751317"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.1.</span> Additional Information</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The contingent workforce includes independent contractors, temporary workers hired through employment agencies, on-call or day laborers, and on-site workers whose services are provided through contract firms.</li>
<li>A firm is likely to use contingent IT workers if it experiences pronounced fluctuations in its technical staffing needs.</li>
<li>Typically, these workers join a team of full-time employees and other contingent workers for the life of the project and then move on to their next assignment.</li>
<li>Whether they work, when they work, and how much they work depends on the company’s need for them.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgbe38f71" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgbe38f71"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.2.</span> How to obtain contingent workers?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-2">
<p>
Organizations can obtain contingent workers in one of the following two ways.
</p>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="orge84d664"></a>Temporary Staffing Farms<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-2-1">
<p>
Temporary staffing firms recruit, train, and test job seekers in a wide range of job categories and skill levels, and then assign them to clients as needed.
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Temporary employees are often used to fill in during staff vacations and illnesses,handle seasonal workloads, and help staff special projects.</li>

<li>They are not considered official employees of the company, so they are not eligible for company benefits such as vacation, sick pay, and medical insurance</li>

<li>Because temporary workers do not receive additional compensation through company benefits, they are often paid a higher hourly wage than full-time employees doing equivalent work.</li>

<li>Temporary working arrangements sometimes appeal to people who want maximum flexibility in their work schedule as well as a variety of work experiences. Other workers take temporary work assignments only because they are unable to find more permanent work.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="orgc2f5a92"></a>Employee Leasing<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-2-2">
<p>
In Employee leasing, a business (called the <code>subscribing firm</code>) transfers all or part of its workforce to another firm (called the <code>leasing firm</code>), which handles all human-resource-related activities and costs, such as payroll, training, and the administration of employee benefits.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Employee leasing firms operate with minimal administrative, sales, and marketing staff to keep down overall costs, and they pass the savings on to their clients.</li>
<li>Employee leasing firms are subject to special regulations regarding workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance. Because the workers are technically employees of the leasing firm, they may be eligible for some company benefits through the firm.</li>

<li>The subscribing firm leases these workers, but they remain employees of the leasing firm.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org121f916"></a>Coemployment<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-1-2-2-2-1">
<p>
Employee leasing is a type of <code>coemployment</code> relationship, in which <code>two employers</code> have actual or potential legal rights and duties with respect to the same employee or group of employees.
</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><a id="org0ffdc89"></a>Consulting Firms<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-2-3">
<p>
Organizations can also obtain temporary IT employees by hiring a consulting firm. Consulting organizations maintain a staff of employees with a wide range of skills and experience, up to and including world-renowned industry experts; thus, these firms can often provide the exact skills and expertise that an organization requires for a <code>particular project</code>.

Consulting firms work with their clients on engagements for which there are typically well-defined expected results or deliverables that must be produced (e.g., creation of an IT strategic plan, implementation of an enterprise resource planning [ERP] system, or selection of a hardware vendor).
</p>

<p>
The contract with a consulting firm typically specifies the length of the engagement and the rate of pay for each of the consultants, who are directed on the engagement by a senior manager or director from the consulting firm.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-3">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>When a firm employs a contingent worker, it does not usually have to provide benefits such as insurance, paid time off, and contributions to a retirement plan.</li>

<li>A company can easily adjust the number of contingent workers it uses to meet its business needs, and can release contingent workers when they are no longer needed. An organization cannot usually do the same with full-time employees without creating a great deal of ill will and negatively impacting employee morale.</li>

<li><p>
Moreover, because many contingent workers are already specialists in a particular task, a firm does not customarily incur training costs for contingent workers.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the use of contingent workers can enable a firm to meet its staffing needs more efficiently, lower its labor costs, and respond more quickly to changing market conditions.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-4">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>One downside to using contingent workers is that they may not feel a strong connection to the company for which they are working. This can result in a low commitment to the company and its projects, along with a high turnover rate.</li>

<li>Although contingent workers may already have the necessary technical training for a temporary job, many contingent workers gain additional skills and knowledge while working for a particular company; those assets are lost to the company when a contingent worker departs at a project’s completion.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The <code>trade-off</code> between completing a single project quickly and cheaply versus developing people within its own organization.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If the project requires unique skills that are probably not necessary for future projects, there may be little reason to invest the additional time and costs required to develop those skills in full-time employees. Or,</li>
<li>if a particular project requires only temporary help that will not be needed for future projects, the use of contingent workers is a good approach.</li>
</ol>


<p>
However, organizations should carefully consider whether or not to use contingent workers when those workers are likely to learn <code>corporate processes and strategies</code> that are key to the company’s success. It is next to impossible to prevent contingent workers from passing on such information to subsequent employers. This can be damaging if the worker’s next employer is a major competitor.
</p>

<p>
Though using contingent workers is often the most flexible and cost-effective way to get a job done, their use can raise <code>ethical and legal issues about the relationships</code> among the staffing firm, its employees, and its customers—including the potential liability of a staffing firm’s customers for withholding payroll taxes, payment of employee retirement benefits and health insurance premiums, and administration of workers’ compensation to the staffing firm’s employees.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, Depending on how closely workers are <code>supervised and how the job is structured</code>, contingent workers may be viewed as permanent employees by the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, or a state’s workers’ compensation and unemployment agencies.

an opportunity. Why pay a U.S. IT worker a six-figure salary, they reason, when they can
use offshore outsourcing to hire three India-based workers for the same cost? However, this
attitude might represent a short-term point of view—offshore demand is driving up salaries
in India by roughly 15 percent per year. Because of this, Indian offshore suppliers have
begun to charge more for their services. The cost advantage for offshore outsourcing to India
used to be 6:1 or more—you could hire six Indian IT workers for the cost of one U.S. IT
worker. The cost advantage is shrinking, and once it reaches about 1.5:1, the cost savings
will no longer be much of an incentive for U.S. offshore outsourcing to India.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<p>
whistle-blowing is an effort to attract public attention to a negligent, illegal, unethical, abusive, or dangerous act by a company or some other organization.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, whistle-blowers are employees who act as informants on their company, revealing information to enrich themselves or to gain revenge for a perceived wrong. In most cases, however, whistle-blowers act ethically in an attempt to correct what they think is a major wrongdoing, often at great personal risk.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-6-1">
<p>
Unfortunately, no comprehensive federal law protects all whistle-blowers from retaliatory acts. Instead, numerous laws protect a certain class of specific whistle-blowing acts in various
industries. To make things even more complicated, each law has different filing provisions, administrative and judicial remedies, and statutes of limitations (which set time limits for
legal action)
</p>

<p>
From the whistle-blower’s perspective, a short statute of limitations is a major weakness of many whistle-blower protection laws. Failure to comply with the statute of limitations is a favorite defense of firms accused of wrongdoing in whistle-blower case
</p>

<p>
The <code>qui tam</code> (“who sues on behalf of the king as well as for himself”) provision of the False Claims Act allows a private citizen to file a suit in the name of the U.S. government, charging fraud by government contractors and other entities who receive or use govern- ment funds. In qui tam actions, the government has the right to intervene and join the legal proceedings. If the government declines, the private plaintiff may proceed alone. Some states have passed similar laws concerning fraud in state government contracts.
</p>

<p>
The <code>False Claims Act</code> provides strong whistle-blower protection. Any person who is discharged, demoted, harassed, or otherwise discriminated against because of lawful acts of whistle-blowing is entitled to all relief necessary “to make the employee whole.” Such relief may include job reinstatement; double back pay; and compensation for any special damages, including litigation costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.36

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Intellectual property is a term used to describe works of the mind—such as art, books, films, formulas, inventions, music, and processes—that are distinct and owned or created by a single person or group.
</p>

<p>
Copyright law protects authored works, such as art, books, film, and music.
</p>

<p>
Defining and controlling the appropriate level of access to intellectual property are
complex tasks. For example, protecting computer software has proven to be difficult because
it has not been well categorized under the law. Software has sometimes been treated as the
expression of an idea, which can be protected under copyright law. In other cases, software
has been treated as a process for changing a computer’s internal structure, making it eligible
for protection under patent law. At one time, software was even judged to be a series of
mental steps, making it inappropriate for ownership and ineligible for any form of protectio

<h3 id="org942870d"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Copyright</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
A copyright is the exclusive right to distribute, display, perform, or reproduce an
original work in copies or to prepare derivative works based on the work. Copyright
protection is granted to the creators of “original works of authorship in any tangible
medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived,
reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or
device.
</p>

<p>
Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights secured by the owner of a copyright.
Infringement occurs when someone copies a substantial and material part of another’s
copyrighted work without permission. The courts have a wide range of discretion in award-
ing damages—from $200 for innocent infringement to $100,000 for willful infringement.
</p>


<p>
The types of work that can be copyrighted include architecture, art, audiovisual works,
choreography, drama, graphics, literature, motion pictures, music, pantomimes, pictures,
sculptures, sound recordings, and other intellectual works, as described in Title 17 of the
U.S. Code. To be eligible for a copyright, a work must fall within one of the preceding
categories, and it must be original.
</p>

<p>
However, evaluating the originality of a work is not always a straight-
forward process, and disagreements over whether or not a work is original sometimes lead
to litigation
</p>

<p>
Some works are not eligible for copyright protection, including those that have not
been fixed in a tangible form of expression (such as an improvisational speech) and those
that consist entirely of common information that contains no original authorship, such as
a chart showing conversions between European and American units of measure.

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) was signed into law in 1998 and implements two 1996 WIPO treaties: the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. The act is divided into the following five sections:
</p>
</div>
<ol class="org-ol">

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-2-5-1">
<p>
This section implements the WIPO treaties by making certain technical amendments to U.S. law in order to provide appropriate references and links to the treaties. It also creates two new prohibitions in the Copyright Act (Title 17 of the U.S. Code)—one on circumvention of technological measures used by copyright owners to protect their works and one on tampering with copyright management information. Title I also adds civil remedies and criminal penalties for violating the prohibitions.

<h3 id="orga23257e"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Patent</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
A patent is a grant of a property right issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to an inventor.
</p>

<p>
A patent permits its owner to exclude the public from making, using, or selling a protected invention, and it allows for legal action against violators. 
</p>

<p>
Unlike a copyright, a patent prevents independent creation as well as copying. Even if someone else invents the same item independently and with no prior knowledge of the patent holder’s invention, the second inventor is excluded from using the patented device without permission of the original patent holder.
</p>

<p>
A software patent claims as its invention some feature or process embodied in instructions executed by a computer.
</p>

<p>
<code>Patent infringement</code>, or the violation of the rights secured by the owner of a patent, occurs when someone makes unauthorized use of another’s patent. Unlike copyright infringement, there is no specified limit to the monetary penalty if patent infringement is found. In fact, if a court determines that the infringement is intentional, it can award up to three times the amount of the damages claimed by the patent holder. The most common defense against patent infringement is a counterattack on the claim of infringement and the validity of the patent itself. Even if the patent is valid, the plaintiff must still prove that every element of a claim was infringed and that the infringement caused some sort of damage.

<h3 id="org1a20747"><span class="section-number-3">2.4.</span> Cross-Licensing Agreements</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
Many large software companies have cross-licensing agreements in which each party agrees not to sue the other over patent infringement.
</p>

<p>
Major IT firms usually have little interest in cross-licensing with smaller firms. As a result, small businesses must pay an additional cost from which many larger companies are exempt. Furthermore, small businesses are generally unsuccessful in enforcing their patents against larger companies. Should a small business bring a patent infringement suit against a large firm, the larger firm can overwhelm the small business with multiple patent suits, whether they have merit or not.

<h3 id="org9ba3c27"><span class="section-number-3">2.5.</span> Trade Secret</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
A trade secret was defined as business information that represents something of economic value, has required effort or cost to develop, has some degree of uniqueness or novelty, is generally unknown to the public, and is kept confidential.
</p>

<p>
Trade secret protection begins by identifying all the information that must be protected—from undisclosed patent applications to market research and business plans and developing a comprehensive strategy for keeping the information secure. 
</p>

<p>
Trade secret law protects only against the misappropriation of trade secrets. If competitors come up with the same idea on their own, it is not misappropriation; in other words, the law doesn’t prevent someone from using the same idea if it was developed independently.

Employees are the greatest threat to the loss of company trade secrets—they might accidentally disclose trade secrets or steal them for monetary gain.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Organizations must <code>educate</code> employees about the importance of maintaining the secrecy of corporate information.</li>
<li>Trade secret information should be labeled clearly as confidential and should only be accessible by a limited number of people.</li>
<li>Most organizations have strict policies regarding <code>nondisclosure</code> of corporate information.</li>
<li>Because organizations can risk losing trade secrets when <code>key employees leave</code>, they often try to prohibit employees from revealing secrets by adding nondisclosure clauses to employment contracts. Thus, departing employees <code>cannot take copies of computer programs or reveal the details of software owned by the firm.</code></li>
<li>Another option for preserving trade secrets is to have an <code>experienced member of the Human Resources Department</code> conduct an exit interview with each departing employee. A key step in the interview is to review a checklist that deals with confidentiality issues. At the end of the interview, the departing employee is asked to sign an acknowledgment of responsibility not to divulge any trade secrets.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-7-2">
<p>
Reverse engineering is the process of taking something apart in order to understand it, build a copy of it, or improve it. Reverse engineering was originally applied to computer hardware but is now commonly applied to software as well.
The use of reverse engineering, saying it can uncover software designs that someone else has developed at great cost and taken care to protect. Opponents of reverse engineering contend it unfairly robs the creator of future earnings and significantly reduces the business incentive for software development.

<h4 id="org4cc84ba"><span class="section-number-4">2.7.3.</span> Open Source Code</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-7-3">
<p>
Open source code is any program whose source code is made available for use or modification, as users or other developers see fit. The basic premise behind open source code is that when many programmers can read, redistribute, and modify a program’s code, the software improves.
</p>

<p>
A software developer could attempt to make a program open source simply by putting it into the public domain with no copyright. This would allow people to share the program and their improvements, but it would also allow others to revise the original code and then distribute the resulting software as their own proprietary product. Users who received the program in the modified form would no longer have the free- doms associated with the original software. Use of an open source license avoids this scenario.

<h4 id="org7e79b28"><span class="section-number-4">2.7.4.</span> Competitive Intelligence</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-7-4">
<p>
Competitive intelligence (as defined in Chapter 3) is legally obtained information that is gathered to help a company gain an advantage over its rivals. For example, some companies have employees who monitor the public announcements of property transfers to detect any plant or store expansions of competitors. An effective competitive intelligence program requires the continual gathering, analysis, and evaluation of data with controlled dissemination of useful information to decision makers.
</p>

<p>
Competitive intelligence is not the same as industrial espionage, which is the use of illegal means to obtain business information not available to the general public.
</p>

<p>
Competitive intelligence analysts must avoid unethical or illegal actions, such as lying,
misrepresentation, theft, bribery, or eavesdropping with illegal devices.

Companies that want to establish an online presence know that the best way to capitalize on the strengths of their brand names and trademarks is to make the names part of the domain names for their Web sites. When Web sites were first established, there was no procedure for validating the legitimacy of requests for Web site names.
</p>

<p>
The main tactic organizations use to circumvent cybersquatting is to protect a trademark by registering numerous domain names and variations as soon as the organization knows it wants to develop a Web presence.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
Professionalism: A profession is a calling that requires specialized knowledge and often long intensive academic preparation.
</p>

<p>
IT workers require intensive training, continuous learning with changing techstacks and a key role is in their experience. And so IT Workers are also professionals.
</p>

<p>
Many business workers have <code>duties, backgrounds, and training</code> that qualify them to be classified as professionals, including marketing analysts, financial consultants, and IT specialists such as mobile application developers, software engineers, systems analysts, and network administrators.
</p>

<p>
One could argue, however, that not every IT role requires <code>“knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study,”</code> to quote again from the United States Code. From a legal perspective, IT workers are not recognized as professionals because they are not licensed by the state or federal government. This distinction is important, for example, in malpractice lawsuits, as many courts have ruled that IT workers are not liable for malpractice because they do not meet the legal definition of a professional.

<p>
IT workers provide services to clients; sometimes those “clients” are coworkers who are part of the same organization as the IT worker. In other cases, the client is part of a different organization.
</p>

<p>
Typically, the client makes decisions about a project on the basis of information, alternatives, and recommendations provided by the IT worker. The client trusts the IT worker to use his or her expertise and to act in the client’s best interests. The IT worker must trust that the client will provide relevant information, listen to and understand what the IT worker says, ask questions to understand the impact of key decisions, and use the information to make wise choices among various alternatives. Thus, the responsibility for decision making is shared between client and IT workers.

IT workers can develop good relationships with suppliers by dealing fairly with them and not making unreasonable demands. Threatening to replace a supplier who can’t deliver needed equipment tomorrow, when the normal industry lead time is one week, is aggressive behavior that does not help build a good working relationship.
