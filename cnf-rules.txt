Task 1
- Eliminate epsilon productions
- Elimianate Unit Production
- Elimiate Useless symbols (Generative(e), Reachable)
- Rename large symbols to smaller symbols (S->ABC to S->AE, E->BC)


Given Grammar:
S -> ASB | e
A -> aAS | a
B -> SbS | A | bb

-> Eliminating Epsilon Productions:
S -> ASB | AB
A -> aAS | aA
B -> b | bS | Sb | A | bb

-> Eliminate Unit Productios:
S -> A | aSa
A -> B | aB
B -> c | cBc

Herem B is a unit production
S -> A | aSa
A -> c | cBc | aB
B -> c | cBc

-> Eliminate Useless Symbols
NonGenerative, Unreachable
S -> AB | C
A -> aA | a
B -> bB
C -> c
Here, B is not generatative
S -> C
A -> aA | a
C -> c
Reachable: Productions that we can reach from Start Symbol
Here, A is not reachable.
S -> C
C -> c
-> Rename
- If a state is greater than 2, than split it.

let[] = X Y Z
S -> ABCD | DEF
S -> AX | DZ
X -> BY
Y -> CD
Z -> EF
